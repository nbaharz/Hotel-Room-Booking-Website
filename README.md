# Hotel Room Booking Website
**Project Purpose:**
The goal of this project is to create a platform where users can easily book accommodation options such as houses and hotels, and property owners can rent out their properties. By making accommodation services accessible online, this project aims to provide a user-friendly experience for both customers and property owners.

**Project Summary:**
Within the scope of this project, a website has been developed that allows users to browse and book accommodation options such as houses or hotel rooms. Users can add their favorite properties to a favorites list and track their bookings through their profile page. Property owners can list their properties on the platform, view reservation requests, approve or cancel them.
Through the admin panel, site administrators can manage users and property listings. Additionally, users can leave reviews to share their accommodation experiences. The project includes both frontend and backend development stages, aiming to provide a comprehensive solution that meets the needs of both users and property owners.
